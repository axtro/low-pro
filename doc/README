Low Pro - Unobtrusive Scripting Extensions to Prototype
-------------------------------------------------------

Low Pro is a small JavaScript library built as an extension to Prototype that makes unobtrusive DOM scripting much easier.  Here's a rundown of the functionality:

* Optimsed $$ - function for much fast CSS node selection.
* Event.onReady() - add callbacks that execute as soon as the DOM is ready.
* Event.addBehavior() - add behaviors to elements declaritively using CSS selectors.
* $('element').observe() - event handling methods added to elements.
* callback scope fixed for Event.observe - this always refers to the element in event handlers.
* Event.trigger() - trigger an elements event handlers for a specific event.

This library is based on the work of many great JavaScript programmers:

Dean Edwards, John Resig and Matthias Miller: dom ready work.
Justin Palmer: event:Selectors which is the basis for addBehavior.
Sylvian Zimmer: $$ optimisation.
